### Background:

LinkedIn is the world's most extensive professional network online. 
Students at tier 1 colleges often thrive due to a strong network of seniors who serve as mentors.
In contrast, students from tier 2 or 3 colleges typically require additional mentorship to succeed in their careers. 
These students often struggle to advance due to a lack of guidance stemming from a weaker network of experienced seniors. 
Some professionals are eager to mentor these students but face challenges in identifying dedicated and passionate individuals who are truly committed to building their careers.

### Primary Objective:
